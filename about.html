        <h3>A Few Words About Us</h3>
        <body>
        <p1>Hello, We are a Cuisson
          <div>We are a small team made up of a group of friends who met on a beginners Coding Course in 2018. </div>
          <div>The group made up of: Verity, Ruby, Christina and Ameenah, all have a passion for food.</div>
          <div>We decided to create a website showcasing the latest recipes of delicious food,
          highlighting the current trends in cakes and other savoury snacks.</div>
          <div>We try to share recipes that are healthy and nutricious but also yummy for the whole family to enjoy!</div>
          <div>If you have any suggestions for what else you would like to see on our website, then please Contact Us and let us know!</div></p1></body>
